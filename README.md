# ZnPINNLab

Repository for a lab course about Physics informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
The course is part of the advanced physics lab, which is a module in the masters programm of physics at the University of Stuttgart.

The course aims to teach the fundamentals of neural networks, by learning the physics of a differential equation using a PINN.
