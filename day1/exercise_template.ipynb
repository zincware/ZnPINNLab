    "# Exercise on datapreparation\n",
    "Working with neural networks involves managing vast amounts of data, and when you're dealing with multiple datasets, things can quickly spiral into chaos.<br> In order to keep the entropy of the system low, this notebook introduces you to a fundamental tool for data management: dictionaries. <br>Dictionaries provide an elegant solution to maintain structure and clarity in your data, making it easier to work with various sets of input and labeled output data.\n",

    "\n",
    "But that's not all. We'll also delve into the power of automation, demonstrating how dictionaries can be harnessed to streamline tasks like dataset creation.<br> This notebook will provide hands-on exercises on dictionaries, functions and for loops, equipping you with essential skills to tackle your upcoming experiment on neural networks."

    "We are now able to create a dictionary with labeled data using the `create_labeled_data` function. But what if we want to create several of them with different time boundaries? The hard way is to create each of them by hand. The smart way is to employ a for loop that iterates over a list of time boundaries. This way, we can maintain multiple dictionaries, each containing labeled data associated with distinct time intervals, within a single overarching dictionary. In other words, we generate a [nested dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_nested.asp).  \n",
